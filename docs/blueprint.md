# **App Name**: FileStatus Tracker

## Core Features:

- Directory Monitoring: Monitor specified network storage paths and local directories for file changes.
- Real-time Dashboard: Display a dashboard table with 'File Name', 'Status', and 'Last Updated' columns, updating in real-time as files change location.
- Status Logic: Implement logic to determine file status ('Imported', 'Failed', 'Published') based on the file's location across the monitored folders.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#2962FF) to imply correctness and information.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5) to provide a neutral backdrop for the data.
- Accent color: Complementary purple (#A35BFF) for interactive elements and key actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif font for a modern, neutral presentation
- A clean, tabular layout for displaying file statuses, with clear visual separation between columns.
- Subtle transition animations when file statuses are updated on the dashboard to provide feedback.
